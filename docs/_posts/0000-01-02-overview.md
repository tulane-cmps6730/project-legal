## Introduction

Despite their ubiquity, terms and conditions are seldom read by users, leading to widespread ignorance about potentially exploitative or unfair clauses. Our project aims to bring these hidden clauses to light by using a sentence level text classifier that labels clauses as either exploitative (1) or non exploitative(0). We based these labels off of categories as outlined in a prior paper we will discuss shortly.
