Bag of Words (BoW)
Logistic Regression Model
Performed the best overall of any other independent model

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Ran into data type mismatches when fitting SVM
Slight improvement in correctly classifying unfair language over 

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Most Complex Independent Model aside from BERT
Did not live up to the hype

Gradient Boosting Machine
Meh, but we learned how to get important features with TF-IFD
Underwhelming results
