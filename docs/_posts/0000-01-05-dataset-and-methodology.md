- **Dataset:** Consisted of 100 labeled terms and conditions documents, each sentence categorized as either fair or one of nine subcategories of unfair.
- **Binary Classification:** Simplified from multiple to two classes (fair and unfair) to address the dataset's imbalance (92% unfair).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, recall, and F1 score, with models trained on an evenly distributed sample for fairness in performance evaluation.
