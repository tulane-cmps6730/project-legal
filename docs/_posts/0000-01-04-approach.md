We employed multiple machine learning approaches to address the challenge of identifying unfair clauses:
- **BERT models:** Utilized for their deep contextual representations.
- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Simplified text representation focusing on term frequencies.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Tested for its capability to establish a clear decision boundary.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Explored for its pattern recognition capabilities within text data.
- **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM):** Chosen for its robustness and iterative improvement on classification tasks.
- **Hybrid BERT/BoW model:** An attempt to combine the strengths of BERT and BoW models.
