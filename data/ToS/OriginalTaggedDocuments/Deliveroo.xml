1. INFORMATION ABOUT US
deliveroo.co.uk is a website operated by Roofoods Limited ("we" or "us" or "Deliveroo"), incorporated and registered in the England and Wales, whose registered office is at 1 Cousin Lane, London, EC4R 3TE, United Kingdom. Our Company registration number is 08167130. Our VAT number is 150 0190 65. Deliveroo is a business where the food is prepared by independent restaurants (our "Partner Restaurants") and delivered by us.
2. PURPOSE
The purpose of our Service is to provide a simple and convenient service to you, linking you to the Partner Restaurant and menu of their choice and allowing you to order Meals from them. Deliveroo markets Meals on behalf of our Partner Restaurants, concludes orders on their behalf and delivers the Meals to you.
3. SERVICE AVAILABILITY
Deliveroo offers an ordering and delivery service from our Partner Restaurants throughout London and elsewhere in the UK. Each Partner Restaurant has a prescribed delivery area. This is to ensure that their Meals reach your door when they are at their best. If you live outside the delivery areas, a message will appear on screen notifying you that ordering online will not be possible. We do not accept orders from individuals to a post code in which we do not have a Partner Restaurant. Operating hours will vary depending on local trading conditions and the availability of our Partner Restaurants. Please click on the relevant link to view the menus on our Service, and then click on your chosen menu which will provide you with the option to submit your order to your chosen Partner Restaurant.
4. ORDERS
When you place an order through our Service, an email thanking you for your order and confirming your order has been received and accepted by the Partner Restaurant (the "Confirmation Email") will be sent to you by us on behalf of the Partner Restaurant. The contract for the supply of any Meal you order through us will be between you and the Partner Restaurant and will only be formed when you have been sent the Confirmation Email by us. Please ensure that you have given us a correct email address as this is how we will communicate with you about your Order. Please also ensure that you provide an accurate address and telephone number to ensure that your Meals arrive to the correct location. If you do not open the door or respond to telephonic correspondence within 10 minutes of our delivery drivers physically reaching your address, we reserve the right to leave the premises, and you will be charged for the Meal. Deliveroo seeks to provide a quality service and will be the first contact in event in there is a problem with your Meal either in regards to food quality and/or temperature. We do monitor our Partner Restaurants very closely and it is of utmost importance to us that they comply with our standards and help us to maintain our reputation. Please let us know if you have any comments relating to our Partner Restaurants or in respect of the Meals by emailing or calling us.
5. MEALS
All Meals are subject to availability. Your Partner Restaurant may offer an alternative for any Meal it cannot provide you with. Our Partner Restaurants may use nuts in the preparation of certain Meals. Please call our Partner Restaurant prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Deliveroo cannot guarantee that any of the Meals sold by our Partner Restaurants are free of allergens.
6. SALE OF ALCOHOL
Persons placing an order for alcohol from our Partner Restaurants must be aged 18 or over. Alcoholic beverages can only be sold and delivered to persons aged 18 or over. Deliveroo operates the Challenge 25 age verification policy whereby customers who are lucky enough not to look 25 or over, will be asked to provide proof of age to show that they are aged 18 or over. By placing an order that includes alcohol, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. Deliveroo reserves the right to refuse to deliver any alcohol to any person who does not appear, or cannot prove they are, aged 18 or over. Deliveroo also reserves the right to refuse to deliver any alcohol to any person who is, or appears to be, under the influence of either alcohol or drugs.
7. AVAILABILITY AND DELIVERY
Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible. Unfortunately things do not always go to plan and factors, such as traffic conditions and weather, may occasionally prevent us from achieving our targets in this regard. We will do our best to ensure that your Meal is delivered by the time specified in the email and webpage. The timing of your order is determined by taking into account the number of orders and the circumstances being faced by the Partner Restaurant at that time.
8. CANCELLATION
You have the right to cancel an order within a reasonable time and before the order becomes a Started Order. A Partner Restaurant will classify a bad order as any order which is cancelled after food has been used to start preparing the order (a "Started Order"). Customers can cancel an order by contacting the Partner Restaurant. Deliveroo and the Partner Restaurant may cancel any order and will tell you once we cancel an order. You will not be charged for any orders cancelled in accordance with this clause. Any payment made prior to an order being cancelled by Deliveroo or a Partner Restaurant will usually be reimbursed using the same method you used to pay for your order. Any order cancelled after it becomes a Started Order will be charged to you. Deliveroo alone will determine whether an order is a Started Order or not.
9. PRICE AND PAYMENT
The price of any Meals will be listed on our Service. Prices include VAT. Prices will vary between menus. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which you have been presented with the Confirmation Email, save in the case of an obvious pricing mistake, whereby we will notify you as soon as we can about the pricing issue. You may be able to cancel your order once we notify you. Despite our best efforts, some of the Meals listed on our Service may be incorrectly priced. The relevant Partner Restaurant will normally verify prices as part of the order process. Payment for all Meals can be made by credit or debit card through our Service. Once your order has been confirmed your credit or debit card will have been authorised and the amount marked for payment. Payment is made directly to Deliveroo and is subsequently passed on by Deliveroo to the Partner Restaurant. We are authorised by our Partner Restaurants to accept payment on their behalf and payment of the price of any Meals to us will discharge your obligations to pay such price to the Partner Restaurant. When we make a delivery, we may at our sole discretion charge you a payment processing fee ("Delivery Fee") which will be notified to you before you complete your order.
