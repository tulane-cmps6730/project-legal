You can respectfully disagree with a message, post or topic, but please do not attack other athletes by mocking or insulting them. If you are attacked by another athlete, and you reciprocate, you may also be subject to the same consequences.
No Hijacking, Trolling, or Flame-baiting. If you are participating in our forums, please stay on-topic in an existing thread, and post new threads in the appropriate forum. Taking a thread off-topic is considered hijacking. Please either contribute politely and constructively to a topic, or move on without posting. This includes posts that encourage the drama in a topic to escalate, or posts intended to incite an uproar from the community.
No Promotion of Unsafe Weight-Loss Techniques or Eating Disorders. One of our goals is to provide athletes with the tools to achieve their weight management goals at a steady, sustainable rate. Use of the Services to promote, glamorize, or achieve dangerously low levels of eating is not permitted. Accordingly, please do not contribute the following types of Content, which may be removed without warning:

No Breach of Legal Duty. Don’t post Content that is in breach of any contractual or other legal duty owed to a third party.
No Deceptive or Fraudulent Links. Don't post deceptive or fraudulent links. This includes giving links misleading descriptions, putting the wrong “source” field in a post, setting misleading click-through links on images, or embedding links to interstitial or pop-up ads.
No Intellectual Property Infringement. Respect the intellectual property of others. If you aren’t allowed to use someone else's proprietary work or likeness (either by license or by legal exceptions and limitations such as fair use), please don’t post it. In particular, if you have any reason to believe that User-Generated Content you see on our Services is infringing your copyrights or the copyrights of others, please see the Copyright/DMCA section of our Terms.
No Impersonating Under Armour or Others. Don’t post Content that is likely to deceive any person or be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person, including with Under Armour.

Other. Don’t post Content that contains anything that, in Under Armour’s sole determination, is objectionable or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Services, or that may expose Under Armour or our athletes to any harm or liability of any kind.

(c) Objectionable User-Generated Content

It’s a big bad Internet out there, and people post inappropriate stuff on user-generated content sites all the time. We do our best to keep the community safe and secure (athletes respecting the Community Guidelines helps), but you still might run into bad stuff before we have a chance to take it down. If you spot any objectionable Content, please let us know.
While we require all of our athletes to comply with the Community Guidelines and reserve the right to monitor for violations, we ultimately cannot guarantee they will comply with the Community Guidelines or these Terms. If you believe any Content submitted to our Services violates the Community Guidelines, or if you know or suspect that someone is misusing your User-Generated Content, please report it to the Customer Support Team.

8. Paid Services

If you choose to subscribe to any of our enhanced, paid services, these are the payment and billing terms that apply. Paid services and billing will auto-renew unless you cancel. You may cancel at any time.
(a) Payment Terms

We offer certain premium versions of the Services (e.g., MVP Membership, MyFitnessPal and Endomondo Premium) (the “Premium Services”) for a fee. By signing up for and using any of the Premium Services, you agree to our Terms, and any additional terms and conditions that are provided here. You also agree to waive your 14-day right of withdrawal to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, so that you are able to immediately access all of the Premium Services.

The Premium Services provide you access to certain enhanced products, services, features and functionality (e.g., premium graphs and analysis, an ad-free browsing experience). By signing up for and using the Premium Services, including signing up for Free Trials of the Premium Services, you agree to pay any fees or other incurred charges that apply to the Premium Services (such as subscription fees).

When you sign up for the Premium Services, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (“Payment Method”). This information must be complete and accurate, and you are responsible for keeping it up to date. You expressly authorize us to collect from your Payment Method the appropriate fees charged for the Premium Services and for any other purchases you elect to make via the Services.

You can choose to pay for the Premium Services on a monthly or annual basis. All fees due for the Premium Services are payable in advance, and will be billed automatically to the Payment Method at the start of the monthly or annual Premium Service period, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated, Premium Services will auto-renew until you elect to cancel your access to Premium Services. All purchases of Premium Services are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service.

(b) Termination or Cancellation of Premium Services

<ter2>If you do not pay the fees or charges due for your use of the Premium Services, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Premium Services (and may do so without notice).</ter2>

You can cancel the Premium Services at any time. More information on how to cancel can be found here. Once you have cancelled your Premium Service and received confirmation, no other changes can be made to your account. The cancellation of a Premium Service will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the Premium Service through the remainder of such billing cycle. For example, if you are billed on a monthly basis and cancel during a given month, you will be charged for the entirety of that month and maintain access to the Premium Service through the end of that month.

There are no refunds for termination or cancellation of your Premium Service. If you no longer wish to subscribe to a Premium Service, it is your responsibility to cancel your Premium Service in due time, regardless of whether or not you actively use the Premium Service.

(c) Fee Changes

<ch2>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change our prices for Premium Services at any time.</ch2> We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the applicable Premium Service and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel the applicable Premium Service prior to the change going into effect.

(d) Discount, Coupon or Gift Codes

If you have received a discount, coupon or gift code to a Premium Service, the following terms and conditions apply in addition to the terms and conditions of the specific code. To redeem a discount or coupon code, log in to the applicable Service and enter the applicable code in the purchasing process to take advantage of the relevant promotion. All discounts, gift and coupon codes can only be applied when subscribing to Premium Services, and they can only be applied to accounts that are not already subscribing to Premium Services. Discount, coupon and gift codes cannot be combined with any other cash-off price, sales, promotion or coupon. Discount, coupon and gift codes cannot be exchanged, refunded, replaced or redeemed for cash or payment of accounts. A payment method may be required to redeem a discount or coupon code. It is your own responsibility to use a discount, coupon or gift code before it expires, and expired codes cannot be refunded or extended. It is also your responsibility to terminate the Premium Service before the end of a free or discounted period if you do not want to continue with a Premium Service at the regular price. The terms and conditions of a specific discount, coupon or gift code may include additional restrictions on its use, including but not limited to the type of plan, duration of free or discounted Premium Service, coupon validity dates, and/or purchase quantities. <ter2>Under Armour reserves the right to cancel discounts and coupon promotions at any time.</ter2>

(e) Free Trials

We sometimes offer free trials of our Premium Services or other promotional offers (each a “Free Trial”). A Free Trial provides you access to the Premium Services for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer.

In order to sign up for a Free Trial, you may need to provide us with your preferred payment method. As soon as you submit your payment details, your Free Trial will begin. You will not be charged until the Free Trial period ends.

Unless you cancel before the end of the Free Trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Premium Service will automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for that Premium Service. All incurred charges are final and non-refundable, except at our sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each Premium Service. We may send you a reminder when your Free Trial is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the Free Trial will end if you decide you do not want to become a paying Premium Services athlete after the Free Trial period.

If you decide that you do not want to become a paying Premium Services athlete, you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Free Trial period. Depending on which of our Premium Services for which you have a Free Trial, you may lose access to the Premium Service as soon as you cancel or at the end of the Free Trial period. Once you have cancelled your Free Trial and received confirmation, you cannot resume the Free Trial period even if you did not use the Premium Service for the entire duration of the offer.

<ch2>Premium Service features and content may change at any time, and we cannot guarantee that any specific feature or content will be available for the entire Free Trial period.</ch2> The rates in effect when you sign up for the Free Trial will be the same when the Free Trial ends, unless we notify you otherwise. <ch2><ter3><ltd2>We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any Free Trial offer, your access to the Premium Services during the Free Trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability.</ltd2></ter3></ch2> You may not sign up for more than one Free Trial of a given Premium Service at the same time, and we reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple Free Trials.

10. Physical Activities

It’s important to us that athletes stay healthy while training. Please be responsible and use your best judgment and common sense. We provide our Services for information purposes only, and can’t be held liable if you get injured or something goes wrong. In particular, while most of the content posted by the other athletes in our community is helpful, it is coming from strangers on the Internet and should never trump good judgment or actual medical advice.
(a) Safety First

Under Armour cares about your safety. You should consult with your healthcare provider(s) and consider the associated risks before using our Services in connection with any physical activity, wellness or fitness program. By using our Services, you agree, represent and warrant that you have received consent from your physician to participate in wellness and fitness programs, workouts, exercises or any of the related activities made available to you in connection with the Services. Everyone’s condition and abilities are different, and participating in the activities promoted by our Services is at your own risk. If you choose to participate in these activities, you do so of your own free will and accord, knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks associated with such activities. Activities promoted by the Services may pose risks even to those who are currently in good health.

You understand and agree that we will not carry out and are not responsible for any physical inspection, supervision, preparation, execution or conduct of any activities related to or accessed or discovered via the Services (e.g., featured, official or community created challenges; routes; friendly competitions or similar activities; any single or group training activities; any Third-Party Activities or other events or activities that utilize our Services). Maps, directions and other GPS or navigation data, including data relating to your current location, may be unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete. We encourage you to always put safety first, follow applicable traffic regulations, do not change settings on your device while in motion or in unsafe areas and always be vigilant and take stock of your surroundings when exercising.

You expressly agree that your athletic activities, which may generate the User-Generated Content you post or seek to post on or via the Services (e.g., running, walking, cycling, hiking) and certain Third-Party Activities carry certain inherent and significant risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death and that you voluntarily assume all known and unknown risks associated with these activities, even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction, or negligence of Under Armour or by the action, inaction, or negligence of others.

<ltd3>Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible or liable, either directly or indirectly, for any injuries or damages that are sustained from your physical activities or your use of, or inability to use, any Services or features of the Services, including any Content or activities that you access or learn about through our Services (e.g., a Third-Party Activity such as a yoga class), even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Under Armour or by the action, inaction or negligence of others.</ltd3> <ltd2>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you also expressly agree that we do not assume responsibility for any Third-Party Activity or any other race, contest, class, athletic activity or event that utilizes or is promoted by or accessed via the Services.</ltd2>

(b) Not Medical Advice

We aim to provide useful general information for our community, not professional medical advice. The Services are not medical devices, and the data provided by them is not intended to be utilized for medical purposes and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease, ailment or injury. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you expressly agree that we are not providing medical advice via the Services. All Content provided through the Services, whether provided by us or by other athletes or third parties (even if they are claiming to be a doctor!) is not intended to be and should not be used in place of (a) the advice of your physician or other professionals, (b) a visit, call or consultation with your physician or other medical professionals, or (c) information contained on or in any product packaging or label. We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, consultations, products, or events you learn about through the Services. Should you have any health related questions, please call or see your physician or other healthcare provider promptly. If you have an emergency, call your physician or your local emergency services immediately.

Your use of the Services does not constitute or create a doctor-patient, therapist-patient or other healthcare professional relationship between Under Armour and you.

(c) Accuracy

The Services are intended to provide you with information to encourage you to support your wellness and fitness activities. Some of the Services are aimed at tracking your physical movements and sleep activity (“Activity Tracking Services”). These Activity Tracking Services rely on sensors and/or GPS functionality that track your movement or body at rest. The data and information provided by the Activity Tracking Services are intended to be a representation of your activity, but may not be completely accurate, including with respect to step, sleep, speed, distance, or calorie data.

11. Modifications to the Terms and Product-Specific Terms

<ch2>As Under Armour grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms or include additional terms that are specific to certain products.</ch2>
(a) Updates to these Terms

<ch2>Under Armour reserves the right to modify these Terms by (i) posting revised Terms on and/or through the Services, and/or (ii) providing advance notice to you of material changes to the Terms, generally via email where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on the home page of the Under Armour websites or in our applications).</ch2> Modifications will not apply retroactively unless required by law.

We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to or reject a revised version of the Terms. In such cases, modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of the Terms. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the Services. In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified version of the Terms, the modified version of the Terms will become effective as of the date specified in the Terms. <use2>Your use of the Services following that date constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms as modified.</use2> If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services.

(b) Product-Specific Terms

We may also require you to agree to additional terms, rules, policies, guidelines, or other conditions (collectively, “Product-Specific Terms”) that are specific to certain Services (for example, the Commercial Tools). In such cases, you may be required to expressly consent to Product-Specific Terms. For instance, you might need to check a box or click on a button marked “I agree.” If any of the Product-Specific Terms are different than the Terms, the Product-Specific Terms will supplement, amend, or supersede the Terms, but only with respect to the subject matter of the Product-Specific Terms.

12. No Warranties

EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, UNDER ARMOUR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAW. THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS. Without limiting the foregoing, you understand that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any of the Services or any Content. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we do not warrant that (i) the Services will meet your requirements, (ii) the operation of the Services will be uninterrupted, virus- or error-free or free from other harmful elements or (iii) errors will be corrected. Any oral or written advice provided by our agents or us does not and will not create any warranty. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we also make no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content; User-Generated Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of the athletes providing that Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from other athletes or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein. You therefore expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Services is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.

13. Limitation of Liability

We are building the best Services we can for you but we can't promise they will be perfect. We're not liable for various things that could go wrong as a result of your use of the Services.
<ltd2>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstances (including, without limitation, negligence) shall Under Armour, its subsidiaries, partners or any wireless carriers be liable to you or any third party for (a) any indirect, incidental, special, reliance, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever; (b) loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses; (c) damages relating to your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services; (d) damages relating to any conduct or content of any third party or athlete using the Services, including without limitation, defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct or content; and/or (e) damages in any manner relating to any Third-Party Content, Third-party Products or Third-Party Activities accessed via the Services.</ltd2> <ltd2>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, this limitation applies to all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, whether or not Under Armour has been informed of the possibility of such damage, and further where a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose.</ltd2> <ltd2>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total liability of Under Armour, for any claim under these Terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the greater of one thousand dollars (us $1,000.00) or the amount you paid us to use the applicable Service(s) in the past twelve months.</ltd2>

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that we offer the Services and set the Services’ prices in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability set forth in the Terms. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you also acknowledge and agree that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and us and that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between you and us. We would not be able to provide the Services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability.

If you are a resident of California: You waive your rights with respect to California Civil Code Section 1542, which says “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”

14. Indemnification

If we are sued because of your access or use of the Services, you have to pay our costs.
If you are a resident of the United States or any country other than France or Germany: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Under Armour, its subsidiaries, suppliers and other partners harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable accounting and attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) the User-Generated Content you access or share through the Services; (b) your use of the Services, (c) your athletic activities in connection with the Services (including, but not limited to, athletic activities in connection with any contests, races, group activities, Third-Party Activities or other events that we may sponsor, organize, participate in, or where the Services are employed), (d) your connection to the Services, (e) your violation of these Terms, (f) your use or misuse of any athlete’s Personal Data and Location Data, (g) any violation of the rights of any other person or entity by you, or (h) your employment of the Services to meet another athlete in person or to locate and attend any offline place or event.

If you are a resident of France or Germany: Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, you agree to indemnify and hold Under Armour, its subsidiaries, suppliers and other partners harmless from any claim or demand as result of your negligent or intentional behavior, including reasonable accounting and attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) the User-Generated Content you access through the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your use or misuse of any athlete’s Personal Data and Location Data, (d) any violation of the rights of any other person or entity by you, or (e) your employment of the Services to meet another athlete in person or to locate and attend any offline place or event.

15. Governing Law

<law2>If you are a resident of the United States or any non-European Union country: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland and controlling U.S. federal law as applicable, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</law2>

<law2>If you are a resident of the European Union: These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Dutch law, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</law2>

<law2>If you are a resident of Canada: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any purchase using a Visa credit card at Under Armour’s Canada website, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Canadian law, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</law2>

16. Disputes and Arbitration, Jurisdiction and Venue

If we have a problem, let’s practice good sportsmanship and resolve the dispute through arbitration.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and Under Armour agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. <a2>Except where prohibited, you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of disputes relating to your general use of the Services under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.</a2> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.

Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, and you waive any right to claim that such location is an inconvenient forum. You agree not to sue us or bring arbitration in any other forum.

The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens for everyone involved:

the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;
the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and
any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition of any claim.

You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us arising out of or relating to your use of the Services:

You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;
You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit involving any such dispute; and
You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose or it is forever barred.
<j3>If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Baltimore, Maryland, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</j3>

This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Under Armour from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Under Armour from (i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state or federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible violation of Under Armour’s intellectual property rights.

In the event of any litigation or arbitration arising from or related to these Terms, or the Services provided, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time, court costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other related expenses incurred in such litigation or arbitration.

If you are a resident of the European Union: Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and Under Armour cannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint through http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.Other than as set out in these Terms, we do not participate in any ADR scheme.

<j1>In addition, nothing in these Terms limits your rights to bring an action against Under Armour in the local courts of your place of domicile.</j1> <j1>All disputes arising under the Terms between you and Under Armour will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in your place of domicile, or the courts located in the Netherlands, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</j1>

If you are a resident of Finland: Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and Under Armour cannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint to the local Consumer Disputes Board (www.kuluttajariita.fi) or other corresponding body.

If you are a resident of Denmark: Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and Under Armour cannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint to the Danish Competition and Consumer Authority (Konkurrence- og Forbrugerstyrelsen, Center for Klageløsning, Carl Jacobsens Vej 35, 2500 Valby, mail: cfk@kfst.dk).

If you are a resident of South Korea: Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, nothing in these Terms limits your rights to bring an action against Under Armour in the local courts of your place of domicile.

17. International Terms

If you are not a United States resident and you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, you agree to transfer certain information outside your home country to us, and that you will follow all the laws that apply to you.
We provide our Services for a global community of athletes. Our servers and operations are, however, located primarily in the United States, and our policies and procedures are based primarily on United States law.

19. Miscellaneous

These miscellaneous provisions are part of just about every online terms agreement. Basically, they ensure that this agreement between us is enforceable.
You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of the Terms or your use of the Services. The Terms and any Product-Specific Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Services.

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

You may not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We have the right, in our sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of our rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third-party contractors to fulfill our duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Services.

Our notice to you via email, regular mail, or notices or links displayed in connection with the Services constitutes acceptable notice to you under the Terms.
