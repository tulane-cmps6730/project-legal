these terms and conditions , its subject matter and duolingo 's and your respective rights under these terms and conditions , as well as and any claim , cause of action or dispute -lrb- `` claim '' -rrb- arising out of or related to these terms and conditions , shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania , united states of america , excluding the conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction , regardless of your country of origin or where you access the service . 
any dispute or claim relating in any way to these terms and conditions or the service will be resolved by binding arbitration , rather than in court , except for duolingo 's right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below . 
unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law , each party shall bear its own attorneys ' fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding . 
if you do not want to arbitrate disputes with duolingo and you are an individual , you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@duolingo.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the service . 
if you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to duolingo 's administration office of your intent to arbitrate -lrb- `` notice '' -rrb- . 
the notice to duolingo should be sent by any of the following means : -lrb- i -rrb- electronic mail to legal@duolingo.com ; or -lrb- ii -rrb- sending the notice by u.s. postal service certified mail to duolingo , inc. , attention : legal , 5900 penn ave ; pittsburgh , pa 15206 . 
the notice must -lrb- x -rrb- describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and -lrb- y -rrb- set forth the specific relief sought ; and -lrb- z -rrb- set forth your name , address and contact information . 
if we intend to seek arbitration against you , we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you . 
the arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator in the county of allegheny in the commonwealth of pennsylvania , whose decision will be final and binding , and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the american arbitration association -lrb- `` aaa '' -rrb- under its aaa commercial arbitration rules , consumer due process protocol , and supplementary procedures for resolution of consumer related disputes , as modified by these terms and conditions . 
the aaa 's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879 . 
all issues are for the arbitrator to decide , including the scope of this arbitration clause , but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these terms and conditions . 
if you initiate arbitration , your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the aaa 's consumer arbitration rules . 
we will reimburse all other aaa filing , administration and arbitrator fees paid by you , unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose , in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the aaa rules . 
the arbitration will be conducted in the english language . 
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction . 
for any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $ 10,000 or less , either you or duolingo may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration . 
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law , you and duolingo each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class , consolidated or representative action . 
if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration , you and duolingo each waive any right to a jury trial . 
if a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable , you and duolingo agree that all claims arising out of or related to these terms and conditions must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the county of allegheny in the commonwealth of pennsylvania , and you and duolingo each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims . 
notwithstanding the above , you agree that duolingo shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies -lrb- or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief -rrb- in any jurisdiction . 
this agreement was originally written in english -lrb- us -rrb- . 
to the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the english version , the english version controls . 
these terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between duolingo and you concerning the subject matter hereof . 
in the event that any of the terms and conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable , such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms and conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect . 
a waiver by duolingo or you of any provision of these terms and conditions or any breach thereof , in any one instance , will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof . 
duolingo may assign its rights or obligations under these terms and conditions without condition . 
these terms and conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of duolingo and you , and duolingo 's and your respective successors and permitted assigns .
