our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information -lrb- including email address -rrb- that you provide us . 
you are obligated to ensure that such contact information is current and accurate . 
your notice to us must be sent to : linden research , inc. , 945 battery street , san francisco , ca 94111 , attention : general counsel . 
for a period of sixty -lrb- 60 -rrb- days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party , linden and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute , though neither party is required to resolve such dispute on terms which each party , in its sole discretion , is uncomfortable . 
if we can not resolve a dispute within sixty -lrb- 60 -rrb- days of receipt of such notice , then either you or we may elect to submit the dispute to formal arbitration as hereinafter described . 
with arbitration -lrb- a -rrb- there is no judge or jury , -lrb- b -rrb- the arbitration proceedings and arbitration outcome are subject to certain confidentiality rules , and -lrb- c -rrb- judicial review of the arbitration outcome is limited . 
further , you and linden lab agree that , should resolution of the dispute -lrb- s -rrb- occur in arbitration , such dispute -lrb- s -rrb- will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party . 
but if , for any reason , any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to this arbitration provision holds that this restriction , limiting the arbitration to dispute -lrb- s -rrb- between you and linden lab , is unenforceable , then our agreement above to arbitrate will not apply and the dispute must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of san francisco county , california . 
should either you or linden lab elect to resolve the dispute by way of binding arbitration , the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association -lrb- `` aaa '' -rrb- , except that , as noted , in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action . 
if the dispute has a claimed value of not more than $ 10,000,000 , then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single , neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than ten -lrb- 10 -rrb- years ' experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the dispute , who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the aaa 's supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes . 
if the dispute has a claimed value of more than $ 10,000,000 , then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three -lrb- 3 -rrb- member panel , with one member to be selected by each party and the third -lrb- who will chair the panel -rrb- selected by the two -lrb- 2 -rrb- party-appointed members or by the aaa in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules . 
the arbitrator or arbitration panel , as the case may be , will apply applicable law and the provisions of this agreement and any additional terms , will determine any dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis , and will issue a reasoned award . 
if a party properly submits the dispute to the aaa for formal arbitration and the aaa is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty -lrb- 60 -rrb- days of the filing of a `` demand for arbitration , '' then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the judicial arbitration and mediation services inc. -lrb- `` jams '' -rrb- using jams ' streamlined arbitration rules and procedures , or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of linden lab consent to in writing , except , as noted above , that in no event shall the arbitration proceed as a class or representative action . 
the substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $ 10,000,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the dispute set forth in the paragraph above will also apply to any such arbitration under jams or other arbitration service . 
you can obtain aaa and jams procedures , rules , and fee information as follows : 
all parties to the arbitration will have the right , at their own expense , to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing . 
if the dispute has a claimed value of not more than $ 250,000 , an arbitration hearing will be conducted , at your election , either by telephone -lrb- or other mutually agreeable remote technology -rrb- or in city and county of san francisco , california . 
if the dispute has a claimed value of more than $ 250,000 , the arbitration will be conducted in the city and county of san francisco , california . 
you and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator 's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules -lrb- including any rules regarding hardship -rrb- ; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require linden lab to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable , or if the arbitrator -lrb- s -rrb- determine that you would experience an extreme hardship by paying your share of arbitration fees and costs prior to resolution of the dispute , then linden lab will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration . 
discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules . 
the arbitrator 's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the dispute , and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award -lrb- if any -rrb- may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to section 9 of the federal arbitration act . 
the arbitrator must honor the terms of this agreement -lrb- and any additional terms -rrb- and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief -lrb- including attorneys ' fees -rrb- consistent with applicable law . 
10.2 exceptions to requirement to arbitrate . 
notwithstanding the provisions of section 10.1 , either party may seek judicial relief from any court of competent jurisdiction -lrb- a -rrb- to enforce an arbitral award issued hereunder , -lrb- b -rrb- to compel arbitration required hereunder or -lrb- c -rrb- to obtain temporary injunctive relief to prevent imminent and irreparable harm or to preserve the status quo until an arbitrator can be empaneled and determine whether to continue , terminate or modify any such relief . 
in the event of a request for temporary injunctive relief , the requirement for 60 days ' dialogue before an arbitration can be initiated shall not apply . 
as set out in section 10.1 , in the event a court or arbitrator determines that the limitation of the arbitration to dispute -lrb- s -rrb- between you and linden lab -lrb- prohibiting class or representative proceedings -rrb- is unenforceable , the dispute then must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts of san francisco county , california .
