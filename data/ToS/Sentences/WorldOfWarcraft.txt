rules related to `` chat '' , interaction with other users or with blizzard entertainment representatives . 
as part of the game , you may communicate with other users both in writing and orally . 
you may communicate orally by using a voice over internet protocol technology -lrb- the `` voice client '' -rrb- . 
communicating with other users and with blizzard entertainment representatives , in writing or orally , is an integral part of world of warcraft and is referred to in this document together as `` chat '' . 
blizzard entertainment does not eavesdrop or monitor the content of your oral communication through the voice client . 
your written communication may be subject to review , modification , and/or deletion by blizzard entertainment without notice to you .

when engaging in chat in world of warcraft , or otherwise utilizing world of warcraft , you may not : 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- transmit or post any content or use any language , in writing or orally , which , in the sole and absolute discretion of blizzard entertainment , is deemed to be offensive , including without limitation content or language that is unlawful , harmful , threatening , abusive , harassing , defamatory , vulgar , obscene , hateful , sexually explicit , or racially , ethnically or otherwise objectionable , nor may you use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the content and language restrictions listed above ;

rules related to game play . 
game play is what world of warcraft is all about . 
accordingly , the rules that govern game play in world of warcraft are taken very seriously by blizzard entertainment . 
note that blizzard entertainment considers all valid play styles in world of warcraft to be part of the game , and not harassment , so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance , including gravestone and/or corpse camping , is considered a part of the game . 
because world of warcraft is a `` player vs. player '' game , you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you , rather than contacting blizzard entertainment 's in-game customer service representatives , referred to herein as `` game masters , '' for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race . 
nonetheless , certain acts go beyond what is `` fair '' and are considered serious violations of these terms of use . 
those acts include , but are not necessarily limited to , the following : 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- using or exploiting errors in design , features which have not been documented , and/or `` program bugs '' to gain access that is otherwise not available , or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players . 
-lrb- 2 -rrb- connecting , or creating tools that allow you to connect , to world of warcraft 's proprietary interface or interfaces , other than those explicitly provided by blizzard entertainment for your use . 
-lrb- 3 -rrb- using tools that hack or otherwise alter the world of warcraft client or server software . 
-lrb- 4 -rrb- using software products that `` packet sniff '' or provide scripting and/or macroing to obtain information from world of warcraft . 
-lrb- 5 -rrb- anything that blizzard entertainment considers contrary to the `` essence '' of world of warcraft . 
blizzard entertainment may , in its sole and absolute discretion , offer certain users the opportunity to move characters from a heavily populated `` character migration '' server to a server designated by blizzard entertainment as a `` target server . '' 
if you are offered the opportunity to migrate a character , please note the following : 
if your character is a `` guild master , '' it can not be migrated to a target server . 
you must have less than ten -lrb- 10 -rrb- characters on the target server in order to migrate a character to the target server . 
character migrations can only occur when the account that you utilize to play world of warcraft is not in use . 
you can not migrate a character to a target server if the name of the character is already in use on the target server . 
if a character of the same name already exists on the target server , you will be given an opportunity to rename character as part of the character migration process . 
as always , the name must adhere to the naming conventions stated herein . 
in-game mail sent by or in transit to the character that you intend to migrate will not be migrated to a target server . 
all player auctions involving the character that you intend to migrate will be cancelled and the item , deposit , and the high bid returned to the bidder upon character migration . 
the item you placed for sale , or your `` high bid , '' will appear in that character 's mail when it reaches the target server . 
note that blizzard will not be responsible for the loss of in-game funds or items due to the character migration of either a `` buyer '' or `` seller '' to an auction house transaction . 
a target character 's friends list will not transfer to a target server . 
a target character 's guild affiliation will not transfer to a target server . 
a target character 's ignore list will not transfer to a target server . 
consequences of violating the rules of conduct . 
blizzard entertainment may , in its sole and absolute discretion , take whatever action it deems necessary to preserve the integrity of world of warcraft . 
violation of any of the rules of conduct set forth above may result in actions being taken by blizzard entertainment , effective immediately or at a time determined by blizzard entertainment , which may include without limitation : temporarily suspending your access to world of warcraft , permanently terminating your access to world of warcraft -lrb- see article xv , section 2 below -rrb- , modify a character or an account , including without limitation , reducing or removing experience points , skills , levels , in-game currency or items ; or temporarily or permanently suspend , or terminate , your access to an account that you use to access the service . 
without limiting the foregoing , blizzard entertainment retains the right to decline service to any user who violates the bnet tou , the terms of use and/or the eula . 
first and foremost , nothing in these rules will ever place a `` duty '' upon blizzard entertainment to reimburse you by providing experience credit for any experience lost for any reason , unless such loss was caused by blizzard entertainment 's negligence . 
that being said , blizzard entertainment may , at its sole and absolute option , determine to reimburse experience lost by players in certain extreme and unusual situations . 
for instance , blizzard entertainment may decide to reimburse experience lost in the event of a catastrophic server failure . 
in no event is blizzard entertainment obligated to provide any monetary reimbursement or monetary credit . 
remember , at the outset of these terms of use , where we discussed how you were `` licensed '' the right to use world of warcraft , and that your license was `` limited '' ? 
well , here is one of the more important areas where these license limitations come into effect . 
note that blizzard entertainment either owns , or has exclusively licensed , all of the content which appears in world of warcraft . 
therefore , no one has the right to `` sell '' blizzard entertainment 's content , except blizzard entertainment ! 
so blizzard entertainment does not recognize any property claims outside of world of warcraft or the purported sale , gift or trade in the `` real world '' of anything related to world of warcraft . 
accordingly , you may not sell or purchase virtual items for `` real '' money or exchange items outside of world of warcraft . 
please note that blizzard is entitled to and will prevent any such illegal sales . 
world of warcraft is an ` on-line ' game that must be played over the internet through the service , as provided by blizzard entertainment . 
it is your entire responsibility to secure an internet connection and all fees related thereto shall be at your own charge . 
blizzard entertainment will use reasonable efforts to provide the service all day , every day . 
however , blizzard entertainment reserves the right to temporarily suspend the service for maintenance , testing , replacement and repair of the telecommunications equipment related to world of warcraft , as well as for transmission interruption or any other operational needs of the system . 
blizzard entertainment will provide you with 24 hours advance notice of any temporary suspension of world of warcraft on world of warcraft 's log-in screen , except in case of urgency . 
blizzard entertainment agrees to provide the servers and software necessary to access the service until such time as world of warcraft is `` out of publication . '' 
world of warcraft shall be considered `` out of publication '' following the date that world of warcraft is no longer manufactured and/or distributed by blizzard entertainment , or its affiliates . 
thereafter , blizzard entertainment may , in its sole and absolute discretion , continue to provide the service or license to third parties the right to provide the service . 
however , nothing contained herein shall be construed so as to place an obligation upon blizzard entertainment to provide the service beyond the time that world of warcraft is out of publication . 
in the event that blizzard determines that it is in its best interest to cease providing the service , or license to a third party the right to provide the service , blizzard entertainment shall provide you with no less than three -lrb- 3 -rrb- months prior notice . 
neither the service nor blizzard entertainment 's agreement to provide access to the service shall be considered a rental or lease of time on or capacity of blizzard entertainment 's servers or other technology . 
x. testing , maintenance , and other potential interruptions in the service . 
blizzard entertainment shall give users notice on the world of warcraft `` home page '' located at http://eu.battle.net/wow/ prior to blizzard entertainment installing software upgrades , performing testing , or performing maintenance on the servers , data transmission lines , and other systems related to world of warcraft , and/or in the manner set forth in article xii , below , whenever possible . 
note that it is your responsibility to be aware of such notices , and you hereby acknowledge and agree that blizzard entertainment shall not be responsible for any damages which may arise from your failure to read and/or be aware of these publicly posted notices . 
additionally , blizzard entertainment may be required to `` shut down '' one or more servers to repair the hardware , or software , related to world of warcraft . 
while it is blizzard entertainment 's intention to provide the service all day , every day , you hereby acknowledge that blizzard entertainment reserves the right to temporarily suspend the service for maintenance , testing , replacement and repair of the telecommunications equipment related to world of warcraft , as well as for transmission interruption or any other operational needs of the system . 
the present refund regulations do not affect or restrict the statutory refund claims you may have . 
this is an additional refund opportunity contractually offered by blizzard entertainment . 
in the event that you are a `` standard end user , '' you will have the right , but not the obligation , to terminate the service , or be provided with a `` game time adjustment '' to your account in the event that the service is suspended or interrupted for more than three consecutive days -lrb- 72 hours -rrb- without blizzard entertainment providing prior notice of the suspension of service as set forth above , unless the suspension or interruption in the service is due to one of the following events : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a `` force majeure '' event , as defined in article xvi , section 9 . 
below ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- any suspension or interruption of the service that is attributable to you , or to any other third party including without limitation , our internet service provider and any other user of the service ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- any suspension or interruption of the service in the event that blizzard entertainment 's telecommunication providers fail to provide the telecommunication service required to host the service through no fault of blizzard entertainment ; and -lrb- 4 -rrb- scheduled maintenance , replacement , regular examination , and/or construction of equipment for the service where blizzard entertainment posts prior notice of the pending interruption in the service . 
in the event that you are eligible for a `` game time adjustment , '' blizzard entertainment shall credit your account with four -lrb- 4 -rrb- times the amount of time that the service was interrupted . 
note that only current accounts that are in `` good standing '' will be eligible for such a `` game time adjustment . ''

only current accounts that are in `` good standing , '' shall be eligible for a refund . 
accounts that are `` suspended '' by blizzard entertainment for `` non payment , '' or for a violation of these terms of use , are not eligible for a refund . 
in the event that you are eligible for a refund , and you pay a fee to utilize your account for a fixed period of time -lrb- `` fixed fees '' -rrb- , blizzard entertainment shall provide you with a `` pro rata '' refund in the same currency as the currency of payment equal to the fixed fees for the most recent billing period , less the daily charge for the service multiplied by the number of days that the service was available in that billing period . 
if you purchased `` game time '' under a program that provided you the right to utilize the service for a set period of time at a discounted rate -lrb- `` discounted fees '' -rrb- , and you request that blizzard entertainment terminate your account , blizzard entertainment shall provide a pro rata refund calculated by deducting from the discounted fees an amount equal to the monthly fee that is in effect at as of the date you request termination of your account divided by 30 , and then multiply that amount times with the number of days that you have utilized the service in the billing period that you purchased for the discounted fees . 
you are entirely liable for all activities conducted through the account , and are responsible for ensuring that any other person who uses your world of warcraft account is aware of the terms of and complies with this agreement .
