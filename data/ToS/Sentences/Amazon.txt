amazon makes no representations or warranties of any kind , express or implied , as to the operation of the amazon services , or the information , content , materials , products -lrb- including software -rrb- or other services included on or otherwise made available to you through the amazon services , unless otherwise specified in writing .

any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any amazon service , or to any products or services sold or distributed by amazon or through amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration , rather than in court , except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify . 
the federal arbitration act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement . 
there is no judge or jury in arbitration , and court review of an arbitration award is limited . 
however , an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court -lrb- including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages -rrb- , and must follow the terms of these conditions of use as a court would . 
to begin an arbitration proceeding , you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent corporation service company , 300 deschutes way sw , suite 304 , tumwater , wa 98501 . 
the arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association -lrb- aaa -rrb- under its rules , including the aaa 's supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes . 
the aaa 's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879 . 
payment of all filing , administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the aaa 's rules . 
we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $ 10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous . 
likewise , amazon will not seek attorneys ' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous . 
you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone , based on written submissions , or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location . 
we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class , consolidated or representative action . 
if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial . 
we also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights . 
by using any amazon service , you agree that the federal arbitration act , applicable federal law , and the laws of the state of washington , without regard to principles of conflict of laws , will govern these conditions of use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and amazon .
