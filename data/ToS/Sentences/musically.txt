arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . 
arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury , allows for more limited discovery than in court , and is subject to very limited review by courts . 
arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award . 
please visit www.adr.org for more information .

if you and the company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received , you or the company may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court . 
the arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration association -lrb- `` aaa '' -rrb- in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes -lrb- `` rules '' -rrb- , as modified by this eula . 
the rules and aaa forms are available at http://www.adr.org . 
if you are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against the company , then the company will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon the company 's receipt of notice at the arbitration notice address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee , unless your demand is equal to or greater than u.s. $ 1,000 or was filed in bad faith , in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee .

you and the company agree that you and the company may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding .

the arbitrator will apply the laws of the state of california in conducting the arbitration . 
you acknowledge that these terms and your use of the service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce . 
the united states federal arbitration act will govern the interpretation , enforcement , and proceedings pursuant to the mandatory arbitration clause in this eula . 
the foregoing provisions of this dispute resolution section do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party 's copyrights , trademarks , or patents . 
you acknowledge that , in the event the company or a third party breaches this eula , the damage or harm , if any , caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against the company , and your only remedy will be for monetary damages , subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this eula .
