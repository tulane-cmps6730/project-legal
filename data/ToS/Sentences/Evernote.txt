on some occasions , you may be purchasing products or service subscriptions from an authorized reseller . 
please review our commercial terms for information about additional contract terms relating to such purchases . 
is this the only contract i have with evernote ? 
it depends upon how you interact with the evernote service and our software applications . 
if you install any evernote software on your computing devices , you may be asked to agree to an end user license agreement . 
if you pay for an evernote subscription , you will be asked to agree to the commercial terms . 
if you use related evernote products or services -lrb- such as evernote business -rrb- or participate in our user forum , you may also need to enter into a separate agreement with us -lrb- usually by clicking `` accept '' or `` agree '' -rrb- . 
we refer to each of these as a `` separate agreement . ''

will these terms of service ever change ? 
these terms may be amended as new features , technology , or legal requirements arise , so please check back from time to time .

for clarity , email or other communications will not constitute an effective written agreement for this purpose . 
what do i have to do to use the evernote service ? 
first , you need to create an evernote service account . 
you create an account by providing us with an email address and creating a password . 
-lrb- some older accounts also required a username . -rrb- 
we refer to this as your `` basic subscriber information '' . 
we encourage you to use a distinct and non-obvious password that is different from passwords you use for any other service . 
you are responsible for maintaining the accuracy , completeness and confidentiality of your basic subscriber information , and you will be responsible for all activities that occur under your account , including activities of others to whom you have provided your basic subscriber information . 
we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your basic subscriber information secure . 
if you discover any unauthorized use of your basic subscriber information or suspect that anyone may be able to access your private content without authorization , you should immediately change your password and notify our customer support team . 
second , you will need to access your account through a web browser or by installing our client software on your computers , tablets and phones . 
obtaining those devices and paying for their connectivity and data plans is your responsibility . 
evernote also has no responsibility for the availability of the internet and other telecommunication services necessary to access the service . 
can i share my account with someone else ? 
evernote service accounts should not be shared . 
if you share your basic subscriber information with anyone , that other person may be able to take control of the account , and we may not be able to determine who is the proper account holder . 
we will not have any liability to you -lrb- or anyone you share your basic subscriber information with -rrb- as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances . 
since you may use a free evernote service account , and since we provide a number of mechanisms to allow you to share your account content with others , we strongly urge you not to share your information with anyone , unless you are doing so as part of your estate planning purposes , as discussed below . 
once i have an account , what are my rights in the evernote service ? 
once your account is created and you accept these terms , we grant you a limited , non-exclusive license to use the service subject to these terms , for so long as you are not barred from receiving the service under the laws applicable to you , until you close your account voluntarily or until we close your account pursuant to these terms . 
in addition , we grant you a personal , worldwide , royalty-free , non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the evernote software provided to you by or on behalf of evernote , for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the evernote software and enjoy the benefit of the service , subject to any applicable license terms provided with the evernote software and these terms , until your rights are terminated in accordance with such license and/or these terms . 
you do not obtain any other right or interest in evernote or the service . 
evernote 's data protection laws say my data is mine -- what does that mean ? 
you retain copyright and any other rights you already held in your content before you submitted , posted or displayed it on or through the service . 
but you do have to grant evernote a limited license , as described below , so we can make your data accessible and usable on the service . 
other than this limited license and other rights you grant in these terms , evernote acknowledges and agrees that we do not obtain any right , title or interest from you under these terms in any of your content . 
what is the license i have to grant to evernote ? 
in order to enable evernote to operate the service , we must obtain from you certain limited license rights to process your content that is covered by intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating the service are not considered legal violations . 
for example , copyright laws could prevent us from processing , maintaining , storing , backing-up and distributing certain content , unless you give us these rights .

if you elect to use any third party service or application that is integrated with evernote , you also agree that the licenses granted to evernote in the preceding paragraph shall apply to content that is submitted or uploaded through such third party service or application . 
if the third party service or application you elect to use would access or extract content , you grant evernote the right and license to enable third party access to and extraction of your content . 
evernote does not assume any responsibility for , or liability on account of , the actions or omissions of such third party applications or service providers . 
as we rely upon your rights to upload and distribute your content , you represent and warrant to evernote that -lrb- 1 -rrb- you have the unfettered legal rights and authority to submit your content to evernote , to make any other use , publication or other distribution of that content in your use of the service , and to grant the rights granted to evernote under these terms ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- your content complies with our user guidelines and these terms . 
finally , you understand and agree that evernote , in performing the required technical steps to provide the service to our users , may make such changes to your content as are necessary to conform and adapt that content to the technical requirements of connecting networks , devices , services or media . 
what other assurances do i have to grant to evernote ? 
when you use the evernote service to send messages to an email address , to a telephone number via sms , or through a social media account -lrb- e.g. , facebook or linkedin -rrb- that has not been linked to an evernote account , evernote sends such messages on your behalf , and we are relying on your representation to us that you have a direct relationship with the recipient -lrb- s -rrb- and that you are respecting the legal rights of the recipient -lrb- s -rrb- not to receive certain kinds of messages -lrb- such as harassing messages , unsolicited commercial messages , and unwanted sms messages -rrb- .

this means all content created , transmitted , stored or displayed in your account , is your sole responsibility as the person who created the content or introduced it into the service . 
this applies whether the content is kept private , shared or transmitted using the service or any third-party application or services integrated with the evernote service .

if we find that any shared content in your account violates our terms of service -lrb- including by violating another person 's intellectual property or privacy rights -rrb- , we reserve the right to un-share or take down such content . 
i 'm guessing evernote has some rights relating to the service ? 
while you own the content you store within the evernote service -lrb- subject to third party rights -rrb- , you acknowledge and agree that evernote -lrb- and our licensors -rrb- own -lrb- s -rrb- all legal right , title and interest in and to the service , including , without limitation , all software that is part of the service and all evernote software deployed by you or a third party to enable capturing of content originating outside the service , such as evernote scannable , evernote web clipper , the site memory widget or any of the evernote software applications for compatible computing devices that enable access and use of the service through such device -lrb- the `` evernote software '' -rrb- . 
in agreeing to these terms , you also agree that the rights in the service and evernote software , including all intellectual property rights , such as trademarks , patents , designs and copyrights , are protected by one or more of copyright , trademark , patent , trade secret and other laws , regulations and treaties , in addition to these terms and any separate agreement . 
in particular , you agree to not modify , create derivative works of , decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from any evernote software , unless you are expressly permitted to do so under an open source license , we give you express written permission or you are otherwise legally permitted to do so notwithstanding this prohibition . 
right to modify the service . 
we retain the right , in our sole discretion , to implement new elements as part of and/or ancillary to the service , including changes that may affect the previous mode of operation of the service or evernote software .

you also acknowledge that a variety of evernote actions may impair or prevent you from accessing your content or using the service at certain times and/or in the same way , for limited periods or permanently , and agree that evernote has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results , including , without limitation , for the deletion of , or failure to make available to you , any content .
