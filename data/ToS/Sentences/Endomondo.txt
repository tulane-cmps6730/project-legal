disputes and arbitration , jurisdiction and venue 
if we have a problem , let 's practice good sportsmanship and resolve the dispute through arbitration . 
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law , you and under armour agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class , consolidated or representative action . 
except where prohibited , you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of disputes relating to your general use of the services under the rules of the american arbitration association . 
arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . 
arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury , allows for more limited discovery than in court , and is subject to very limited review by courts . 
arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award . 
please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration . 
any arbitration between you and us , to the extent necessary , will be conducted in baltimore , maryland , and you waive any right to claim that such location is an inconvenient forum . 
you agree not to sue us or bring arbitration in any other forum . 
the arbitration will be conducted in english . 
a single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association . 
both you and we agree to comply with the following rules , which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens for everyone involved : 
the arbitration will be conducted by telephone , online and/or be solely based on written submissions , the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration ; 
the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties ; and 
any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction . 
barring extraordinary circumstances , the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed . 
the arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice . 
all arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed , except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award .
