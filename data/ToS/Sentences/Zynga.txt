warranty disclaimer ; services available on an `` as is '' basis

zynga and any zynga affiliate disclaim any warranties of title or implied warranties , conditions or other terms of non-infringement , merchantability , quiet enjoyment or fitness for a particular purpose . 
if your state or country does not allow these disclaimers , they do not apply to you . 
if your state or country requires a certain period for which a warranty applies , it will be either the shorter of 30 days from your first use of the service or the shortest period required by law . 
you acknowledge that zynga and the zynga affiliates are not liable -lrb- 1 -rrb- for any indirect , incidental , special , exemplary or consequential damages , including for loss of profits , goodwill or data , in any way whatsoever arising out of the use of , or inability to use , the service ; or -lrb- 2 -rrb- for the conduct of third parties , including other users of the service and operators of external sites . 
the risk of using the service and external sites rests entirely with you as does the risk of injury from the service and external sites . 
to the fullest extent allowed by any law that applies , the disclaimers of liability in these terms apply to all damages or injury caused by the service , or related to use of , or inability to use , the service , under any cause of action in any jurisdiction , including , without limitation , actions for breach of warranty , breach of contract or tort -lrb- including negligence -rrb- .

if you have not paid zynga or any zynga affiliate any amount in the one hundred and eighty days -lrb- 180 -rrb- days immediately preceding the date on which you first assert any such claim , your sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute with zynga and/or any zynga affiliate is to stop using the service and to cancel your account . 
some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above . 
so these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries . 
if you use or misuse the service , or if you violate these terms or any other applicable rules , including the community rules or feature terms , and that results in loss or damage or in a claim or liability against zynga or any zynga affiliate , you agree to indemnify , defend and hold harmless zynga and/or the zynga affiliate -lrb- which means you agree to compensate zynga and/or the zynga affiliate on a `` dollar for dollar '' basis -rrb- for that loss , damage , claim or liability , including compensating zynga and/or the applicable zynga affiliate for our legal fees or expenses .

you also have to cooperate in zynga 's and/or the zynga affiliate 's defense of these cases . 
zynga and/or the zynga affiliate will use reasonable efforts to let you know if they learn of any claim on which you have to compensate or reimburse them . 
this will apply even if you stop using the services or your account is deleted . 
agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver 
this section only applies to players in the us and canada . 
if you are having a problem with the service , many issues can be resolved on one of our forums . 
for issues relating to certain naturalmotion games , you may find resolution by clicking on the `` support '' link on that game 's page on naturalmotion 's website . 
before bringing a formal legal case , first contact our customer support team at https://zyngasupport.helpshift.com , or for black diamond slots , email support@risingtidegames.com , or for natural motion games email contact@naturalmotion.com to address your issue most disputes can be resolved that way . 
if we ca n't resolve our dispute through customer service , you and zynga or any member of the zynga corporate family all agree to resolve any claims relating to the terms , the privacy policy , feature terms or zynga 's services through final and binding arbitration . 
this applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory , unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions in the exceptions to agreement to arbitrate sub-section . 
it also applies even after you stopped using your zynga account or deleted it . 
an arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury , so we are all giving up our right to a trial before a judge and jury . 
arbitrations have different rules than lawsuits in court . 
they are less formal than lawsuits in courts , and provide limited opportunity to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute -- a process called discovery . 
the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual . 
but , if any of us does not like the arbitrator 's decision , the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision . 
if we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute , we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that , too . 
in addition , if you , zynga or a zynga corporate family member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated , the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim -lrb- i.e. , compel arbitration -rrb- . 
you , zynga or the zynga corporate family member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing . 
the american arbitration association -lrb- aaa -rrb- will run the arbitration between you and zynga or the zynga corporate family member , and aaa 's then-current rules and procedures -lrb- including their supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes -rrb- will be used . 
if something in these terms is different than aaa 's rules and procedures , then we will follow these terms instead . 
you can look at aaa 's rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879 . 
to start an arbitration proceeding , use the form on aaa 's website -lrb- www.adr.org -rrb- or call them at 1-800-778-7879 . 
we all agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to 
your , zynga 's , or a zynga corporate family member 's intellectual property -lrb- for example , trademarks , trade dress , domain names , trade secrets , copyrights or patents -rrb- ; or 
your violation of the community rules . 
for more information about which court we can go to for resolving these types of disputes , see section 19 -lrb- venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitration -rrb- . 
we all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis . 
neither you nor zynga nor any member of the zynga corporate family can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action , consolidated action or representative action . 
the arbitrator can not combine more than one person 's claim into a single case , and can not preside over any consolidated , class or representative arbitration proceeding -lrb- unless we both agree to change this -rrb- . 
the arbitrator 's decision or award in one person 's case can only impact the person who brought the claim , not other zynga players , and can not be used to decide other disputes with other players . 
if a court decides that this subsection on `` no class actions '' is not enforceable or valid , then the entire section 17 -lrb- agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver -rrb- will be null and void -lrb- i.e. , go away -rrb- . 
but , the rest of the terms , feature terms , community rules , and privacy policy will still apply . 
changes to section 17 on agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver 
we will give you 60-days ' notice by email or through the service if we change section 17 on our agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver . 
the federal arbitration act -lrb- including its procedural provisions -rrb- is the law that will be applied to determine whether section 17 -lrb- agreement to arbitrate and class action waiver -rrb- can be enforced and how it should be interpreted . 
apart from that , if you are united states resident , these terms and our relationship will be governed by california law , except for its conflicts of laws principles . 
if you reside outside the united states these terms and our relationship will be governed by irish law , except for its conflicts of laws principles . 
venue for legal disputes not subject to arbitration
