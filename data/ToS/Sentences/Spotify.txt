here 's some information about all the ways you can enjoy spotify . 
3.1 our services & paid subscriptions 
spotify provides streaming services offering a selection of music and other content . 
certain spotify services are provided to you free-of-charge . 
other spotify services require payment before you can access them . 
the spotify services that may be accessed after payment are currently referred to as the `` premium service '' and the `` unlimited service '' -lrb- together , the `` paid subscriptions '' -rrb- . 
the spotify service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the `` free service '' . 
you can learn more about our services by visiting our website . 
the unlimited service may not be available to all users . 
we will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services . 
if you cancel your subscription to the unlimited service , or if your subscription to the unlimited service is interrupted -lrb- for example , if you change your payment details -rrb- , you may not be able to re-subscribe for the unlimited service . 
note that the unlimited service may be discontinued in the future , in which case you will no longer be charged for the service . 
if you reside in turkey , your access to the free service may be limited to a fixed amount of listening hours per month . 
3.2 codes and other pre-paid offers 
if you have purchased or received a code , gift card , pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of spotify for access to a paid subscription -lrb- `` code '' -rrb- , separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the code may also apply to your access to the service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions . 
from time to time , we or others on our behalf may offer trials of paid subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate -lrb- a `` trial '' -rrb- . 
spotify reserves the right , in its absolute discretion , to determine your eligibility for a trial , and , subject to applicable laws , to withdraw or to modify a trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability , to the greatest extent permitted under the law . 
for some trials , we 'll require you to provide your payment details to start the trial . 
at the end of such trials , we may automatically start to charge you for the applicable paid subscription on the first day following the end of the trial , on a recurring monthly basis . 
by providing your payment details in conjunction with the trial , you agree to this charge using such payment details . 
if you do not want this charge , you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your spotify account 's subscription page or terminate your spotify account before the end of the trial . 
if you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis , you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your spotify account 's subscription page or terminate your spotify account before the end of the recurring monthly period . 
paid subscriptions can not be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid , and except as expressly provided in these terms , spotify will not refund any fees that you have already paid . 
the limitation section sets forth additional terms regarding cancellation of your paid subscription .

15 payments , cancellations , and cooling off 
paid subscriptions can be purchased directly from spotify or through a third party , such as a telephone company , either by -lrb- 1 -rrb- paying a monthly subscription fee ; or -lrb- 2 -rrb- pre-payment giving you access to the spotify service for a specific time period -lrb- `` pre-paid period '' -rrb- . 
if you have purchased a paid subscription using a code , your paid subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the pre-paid period , or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the service . 
when you register for a paid subscription , trial , or code online , you consent to get access to spotify premium immediately . 
if you reside outside the united states and register for a paid subscription or code online , you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen -lrb- 14 -rrb- days starting from the day you sign-up for the relevant service -lrb- the `` cooling-off period '' -rrb- . 
refunds will not , however , be provided if you have accessed spotify at any time during the cooling-off period . 
unless your paid subscription has been purchased as a pre-paid period , your payment to spotify will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period , unless you cancel your paid subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current subscription period . 
the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period , and you will be downgraded to the free service . 
however , if you cancel your payment or paid subscription and/or terminate any of the agreements -lrb- 1 -rrb- after you have accessed spotify during the cooling-off period , or -lrb- 2 -rrb- after the cooling-off period is over -lrb- where applicable -rrb- , or -lrb- 3 -rrb- before the end of the current subscription period , we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us . 
the refund method will depend upon the payment method . 
if you wish to receive a full refund of all monies paid before the cooling-off period is over , you must contact customer support . 
if you have purchased your paid subscription through a third party , your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that third party -lrb- in addition to these terms -rrb- . 
to cancel your subscription , you must cancel directly with that third party . 
spotify may change the price for the paid subscriptions , pre-paid period -lrb- for periods not yet paid for -rrb- , or codes from time to time , and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and , if applicable , how to accept those changes . 
price changes for paid subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change . 
as permitted by local law , you accept the new price by continuing to use the spotify service after the price change takes effect . 
if you do not agree with the price changes , you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the spotify service prior to the price change going into effect . 
please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully . 
the agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or spotify . 
however , you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual licence granted by you in relation to user content , including feedback , is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the agreements for any reason . 
spotify may terminate the agreements or suspend your access to the spotify service at any time , including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the spotify service and/or content , or non-compliance with the agreements . 
if you or spotify terminate the agreements , or if spotify suspends your access to the spotify service , you agree that spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you and spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid , to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law . 
to learn how to terminate your spotify account , please contact us through the customer service contact form which is available on our about us page . 
this section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law . 
you may terminate the agreements at any time . 
sections 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , and 24 herein , as well as any other sections of the agreements that , either explicitly or by their nature , must remain in effect even after termination of the agreements , shall survive termination . 
we endeavour to provide the best service we can , but you understand and agree that the spotify service is provided `` as is '' and `` as available '' , without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind . 
you use the spotify service at your own risk . 
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law , spotify and all owners of the content make no representations and disclaim any warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality , merchantability , fitness for a particular purpose , or non-infringement . 
neither spotify nor any owner of content warrants that the spotify service is free of malware or other harmful components . 
in addition , spotify makes no representation nor does it warrant , endorse , guarantee , or assume responsibility for any third party applications -lrb- or the content thereof -rrb- , user content , or any other product or service advertised or offered by a third party on or through the spotify service or any hyperlinked website , or featured in any banner or other advertising . 
you understand and agree that spotify is not responsible or liable for any transaction between you and third party providers of third party applications or products or services advertised on or through the spotify service . 
as with any purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment , you should use your judgment and exercise caution where appropriate . 
no advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from spotify shall create any warranty on behalf of spotify in this regard . 
some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions if prohibited by applicable law . 
this does not affect your statutory rights as a consumer .

spotify does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these agreements . 
where permitted under the applicable law , you and spotify agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action . 
unless both you and spotify agree , no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person 's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . 
if you are located in , are based in , have offices in , or do business in a jurisdiction in which this section 24.3 . 
is enforceable , the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you : 
you and spotify agree that any dispute , claim , or controversy between you and spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these agreements or to your relationship with spotify as a user of the service -lrb- whether based in contract , tort , statute , fraud , misrepresentation , or any other legal theory , and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the agreements -rrb- will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration . 
arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court . 
there is no judge or jury in arbitration , and court review of an arbitration award is limited . 
there may be more limited discovery than in court . 
the arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court -lrb- including attorney fees -rrb- , except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration . 
this arbitration provision will survive termination of the agreements . 
notwithstanding clause -lrb- 24.3.1 -rrb- above , you and spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive , preclude , or otherwise limit either of our rights , at any time , to -lrb- 1 -rrb- bring an individual action in small claims court , -lrb- 2 -rrb- pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal , state , or local agencies where such actions are available , -lrb- 3 -rrb- seek injunctive relief in a court of law , or -lrb- 4 -rrb- to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims . 
either you or we may start arbitration proceedings . 
any arbitration between you and spotify will be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce -lrb- the `` icc '' -rrb- then in force -lrb- the `` icc rules '' -rrb- by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the icc rules , as modified by these agreements , and will be administered by the international court of arbitration of the icc . 
any arbitration will be conducted in the english language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the european union or any other jurisdiction , the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the state of california , united states , without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles . 
any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one -lrb- 1 -rrb- year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act , omission , or default giving rise to the claim ; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period . 
if applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims , any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law . 
a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other , by certified mail or federal express -lrb- signature required -rrb- , or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you , by electronic mail -lrb- `` notice '' -rrb- . 
spotify 's address for notice is : spotify , attn : general counsel , 45 w. 18th street , 7th floor , new york , new york 10011 , usa . 
the notice must -lrb- 1 -rrb- describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- set forth the specific relief sought -lrb- `` demand '' -rrb- . 
we agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly , but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the notice is received , you or spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding . 
during the arbitration , the amount of any settlement offer made by you or spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award , if any . 
in the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor , spotify shall pay you -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount awarded by the arbitrator , if any , -lrb- 2 -rrb- the last written settlement amount offered by spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator 's award ; or -lrb- 3 -rrb- $ 1,000.00 , whichever is greater . 
all documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator 's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law . 
except as required to enforce the arbitrator 's decision and award , neither you nor spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration , including , but not limited to , the fact that the parties are in dispute , the existence of the arbitration , or any decision or award of the arbitrator . 
in the event that spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision -lrb- other than a change to spotify 's address for notice -rrb- , you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to spotify 's address for notice , in which case your account with spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision , as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject , shall survive . 
if the class action waiver at section 24.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this section 24.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable , then the entirety of this section 24.3 shall be null and void and , in such case , the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in section 24.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the agreements . 
if you have any questions concerning the spotify service or the agreements , please contact spotify customer service by visiting the about us section of our website . 
if you are a california resident , you may have the agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to spotify , attn : general counsel , 45 west 18th street , 7th floor , new york , new york 10011 , usa with your email address and a request for the agreements . 
in addition , under california civil code section 1789.3 , you may contact the complaint assistance unit of the division of consumer services of the california department of consumer affairs in writing at 1625 n. market blvd. , suite s-202 , sacramento , california 95834 , or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding use of the service .
